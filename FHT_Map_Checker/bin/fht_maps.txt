They were supposed to have been dropped eighteen miles to the northwest at drop zone T near Amfreville, but instead ended-up in the vicinity of the French village of Graignes. Theirs was the worst misdrop of any airborne unit on 6 June 1944. On Saturday, 10 June elements of the 17.

The British 7th Armoured Division under Major General Sir Michael O'Moore Creagh was dispatched to intercept the remnants of the fleeing Italian Tenth Army via Msus and Antelat while the Australian 6th Division chased the Italians along the coast road round the north of the Jebel Akhdar mountains. The poor terrain was hard going for the tanks, and Creagh took the bold decision to send a flying column on wheels only south-west across the virtually unmapped Libyan Desert. In the afternoon of 5 February 1941, Combe Force arrived at the Benghazi  Tripoli road and set up road blocks near Sidi Saleh, some 20 miles north of Ajedabia and 30 miles southwest of Antelat.

Skorzeny was to form a special brigade - Panzer Brigade 150 - for a very special purpose: "I want you to command a group of American and British troops and get them across the Meuse and seize one of the bridges. Not, my dear Skorzeny, real Americans or British. I want you to create special units wearing American and British uniforms. They will travel in captured Allied tanks. Think of the confusion you could cause! I envisage a whole string of false orders which will upset communications and attack morale." Hitler, The Black Angels, 1979;

As the encirclement trap snapped shut on the Schnee Eifel on 17 December, rapid change was occurring at the headquarters of the 106th Division in St. Vith. By midnight  Brigadier General Bruce Cooper Clarke had managed to set up the beginnings of what was called the horseshoe defense of St. Vith, a line of units to the north, east and south of town. When the final attack on St. Vith was launched, the town had become more of a liability than an asset. The Allied retreated out of St. Vith to the west, and German forces poured into the town, happily looting the remaining American supplies and equipment. But soon the US started an attack to re-conquer St. Vith;

The battery had initially been reported to be 88 mm guns firing onto causeway exit #2 leading off Utah Beach and disrupting landing forces of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division advancing inland on this route.  As a result of the crash of a C-47 having killed its company commander, Thomas Meehan III, command of Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division devolved to the company executive officer, 1st Lt. Richard Winters. After linking up with his parent unit at the hamlet of Le Grand Chemin on the morning of June 6, 1944, Winters was ordered up front away from his company. With minimal instructions of: There's fire along that hedgerow there. Take care of it. Createy by Aserafimov, edited by Erwin;

By late summer 1944, the bulk of two German armies had become surrounded by the Allies near the town of Falaise. The Mont Ormel ridge, with its commanding view of the area, sat astride the Germans' only escape route. Polish forces seized the ridge's northern height on 19 August and, despite being isolated and coming under sustained attack, held it until noon on 21 August, contributing greatly to the decisive Allied victory that followed.;
